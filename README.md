PHPNotepad is a code editor aimed towards web developers or individuals that want to learn web programming languages such as PHP. While the name implies it only handles PHP, the editor also supports HTML, CSS or XML. As many code editors, the software features syntax highlighting with the possibility of customizing the styles of those highlights.
The interface is very easy and intuitive, features a fast tabs system and lets you open multiple files at the same time with just a few clicks. While the editor itself doesn't come with additional bells and whistles and it's rather basic in some regards.
